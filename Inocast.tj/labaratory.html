				<h4>DEFINITION OF AN INNOLAB</h4>
				<p>An InnoLab is a space, physical and virtual, within which opportunities for innovation are promoted and developed through collaboration between universities, research institutes, government agencies, businesses and other economic actors to create successful social and institutional formats for the generation of new knowledge and its successful business application.	
				</p>
				<h4>CONCEPT OF AN INNOLAB</h4>
				<p>The concept of the Triple Helix interprets the shift from a dominating industry-government dyad in the Industrial Society to a growing triadic relationship between university-industry-government in the Knowledge Society. An InnoLab is an area which creates opportunities for innovation and economic development in a Knowledge Society and enables a prominent role for the academy in collaboration with industry and government to generate new institutional and social formats for the production, transfer and application of knowledge. Examples of stakeholders, originating from the different branches of the triple helix concept, could be end-users, researchers, industrialists, managers, entrepreneurs, policy makers, and politicians etc. All of them, working together at the earlier stage of the innovation process in order to experiment breakthrough concepts and to generate prototypes and demonstrates with a potential value for society.</p>
			<p>An InnoLab plays an even greater role of catalyst and accelerator of innovation, providing hubs for co-creation, experimentation and learning. The key principles of an InnoLab are:</p>

				
<p>	
<ul class="lab-ul">
<li>Powered by open innovation i.e. innovating with partners by sharing risk and sharing reward.
<li>Supports an interdisciplinary approach.
<li>Supports multi-stakeholder design of knowledge.
<li>Accessible for everyone.
<li>Fulfils the dual mission of design science: 
<li>A.	Contributes with knowledge to society.
<li>B.	Contributes with knowledge to the research community.
<li>Provides a favourable environment for risk-taking.
<li>Supports programs and teachers at the university by disseminating knowledge and experiences for students.
<li>Have access to the latest research on specific areas.
<li>Supports the application processes for research projects.
<li>Builds artefacts in terms of demonstrators and prototypes.
<li>Enables students to get in contact with industry leading entities for job opportunities.
<li>The active involvement of users at all stages of development (co-creation).
<li>Multiple partners from private and public sectors.
<li>Bringing together different disciplines and approaches from design, science, technology and business.
<li>A dedicated space (real or virtual) for experimentation and developing new ideas.
</ul>	
</p>
		<p>
			Through the InnoLab networks, ideas, projects and collaborations are converted into high impact innovations. Innovation is the key element of competitiveness, productivity, economic growth.
	Organisationally an InnoLab is a concept closely related to open innovation that creates an environment of experimentation where businesses, authorities and citizens are involved in the product/service/technology development. The important components are openness for stakeholders with different backgrounds, public involvement and policy support, wide scope involving suppliers, users and other actors in the value chain, realistic and sustainable settings. There are a variety of examples of open innovation platforms (innovation laboratories), idea competitions and action research examples in different educational institutions in a variety of countries.
	It should be noted that the innovation process is itself something that can change over time, from the first development of an idea (invention), through its development into a new product or process, the roll-out of the idea in the innovating establishment, and then the diffusion - implementation of this by further users. At any of these stages further new ideas may be introduced, the design of the innovation may be adapted in the light of feedback as to user requirements or technical problems and so on. Two important aspects are the “product life cycle” and the “industry life cycle”. Each refers to a stylised path of development. In the product life cycle the picture refers to the development of an innovation from being expensive and hard to use, to being cheap and available for low-skill users (and often mass markets). The focus of innovative effort evolves from one on getting the product to work and to be well-adapted to users, to one of mass-producing it easily and cheaply. The industry life cycle points to the parallel phenomenon, where firms rise and decline and production may be moved from highly knowledge intensive locations to ones characterised by cheap and less skilled labour. These “life cycles” are useful frameworks for thinking labour product and industrial change, but there are many cases where the patterns described above are not followed with any precision.
	The InnoLab should give priority to enabling and empowering vast collaboration, therefore it must be multi-stakeholder and open. A high degree of involvement and trust can only be guaranteed by full transparency and in order to make openness, creativity and experimentation compatible with a rigorous systemic approach, the InnoLab should opt for a loose (participative) but tight (directive) organisational model.

		</p>		
		<h4>FUNDING PRINCIPLES OF AN INNOLAB</h4>
		<p>Also, innovation is a long and multifaceted process and the funding system should follow three principles:</p>
		<ul class="lab-ul">
		<li>Visible long term resource opportunities for sustainable innovation.
      	<li>Rolling / multi funding according to the programme steps (prototyping, experimentation, etc.).
		<li>Long-term support for development of working methods & strategies, communication and branding.	
		</ul>
		
		<p>Other issues are related to the impact of financing on the neutrality / objectivity (who pays for what?) and evaluation (to be accountable to whom?) / the qualitative output (impact on the society).</p>
		
		<h4>FORMS AND TYPES OF INNOVATION</h4>
		<p>Four main types of innovation that are discussed in the innovations related literature are as follows:</p>
		<ol class="lab-num" type="1">
		<li>Product innovation (usually technological), where innovation involves the development of new goods, services, machinery, equipment, components, software (or novel assemblages of these);
	    <li>Process innovation, involving new systems or routines of production, again with an emphasis on the tools and equipment and software used in the processes;
	    <li>Organisational innovation, involving where innovation relates to changing management practices or workflow structures;
	    <li>Marketing innovation, involving new ways of relating to customers and potential customers (including new ways of promoting products) - this is closely related to the idea of delivery innovations, targeted at transforming the ways in which products or services reach their consumers.
		</ol>
		
		<h4>INNOLAB MANAGER</h4>
		<p>Every InnoLab is led and administered by the InnoLab Manager. The InnoLab Manager is person who directs and oversees the operations of the InnoLab and provides direct business assistance to clients. This person provides the daily energy and hands on management that is catalytic to the InnoLab mission. The InnoLab Manager must be well connected to professional and technical knowledge networks, including universities, in the community and will serve as a gateway to a resource network of knowledge and service providers that provide expert assistance to InnoLab clients. Groups of skills needed for InnoLab manager:</p>
		<ul class="lab-ul">
		<li>Strategic planning.
  		<li>Financial management.
		<li>Knowledge of research methods.
		<li>Facilitation.
		<li>Communication, negotiation and consulting.
		<li>Brokerage.
		<li>Ability to use wide range of ICT tools.
		<li>Collaboration and networking skills.
		<li>Project management and coordination.
		</ul>	
		
		<h4>METHODS AND TOOLS USED IN AN INNOLAB</h4>
		<p>InnoLab generally follows a systematic process that includes:</p>
		<ol class="lab-num" type="1">
		<li>Observation – the process of horizon scanning for ideas, observing best practices and examples, case studies, gaining inspiration.
 		<li>Testing – the act of implementation of product or service at pilot level, testing for functionality and compliance, field trial.
		<li>Up-scaling – the process of scaling newly established innovation to a higher level, upgrading volume that is being produced, expanding the current offer or variations or product/service.
		<li>Diffusion – the practice of implementation of newly established innovation by further users.
		<li>Exposure – the act of encountering an innovation or information about an innovation without specifically seeking it out.
		<li>Search – the act of actively seeking out an innovation or information about an innovation in a directed and intentional manner.
		<li>Sense-making – the process of coming to understand the nature of an innovation and/or the innovation’s potential relationship to a given actor’s goal(s). Sense-making can be intentionally undertaken as a practice, or more organically occur without specific direction on the part of an  actor.
		<li>Concept creating / Ideation – the practice of intentionally generating ideas for potential innovations that might be further developed by a given actor.
		<li>Prototyping – the practice of creating early-stage pilots or models of a given innovation for the purposes of gaining information that would further the design.
		<li>Experimentation – the practice of engaging in early-stage implementation of a prototype within a variety of contexts with the intention of gaining information that would further the design.
		<li>Refinement – the practice of using information gained through prototyping and experimentation processes in order to change central aspects of an innovation’s design. 
		<li>Iteration – the practice of repetitively engaging in cycles of prototyping, experimentation and refinement for the purposes of systematically improving an innovation. 
		<li>Recontextualization – the practice of adapting a given innovation to a particular context to better meet the needs and priorities of said context.
		<li>Reinvention – the practice of re-conceptualizing a given innovation such that it takes on a substantively distinct new form.
		</ol>
		
		<h4>ENVIRONMENT OF AN INNOLAB</h4>
		<p>One of the main questions is whether InnoLab is virtual or physical space. As the approach consists in doing fieldwork and bringing experts from various backgrounds to work together, an exclusive virtual space is unsatisfactory. Experimentation is very much based on the learning - by making approach. This however, does not mean that every InnoLab creates its own dedicated space for experimentation and testing. However, it is argued that every organisation, community, network should have access to its own experimental environment.
	While some InnoLab’s are acknowledged as permanently established formalised organisations, a number of initiatives take the form of projects / exercises with a specific target and a limited lifespan. But it can also be argued that InnoLab must have the capacity for self-renewal and continuously find and adapt to the most cutting edge and appropriate innovation approaches, world-wide. If they are able to do that, they are sustainable.
